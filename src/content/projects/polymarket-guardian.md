Liquidity providers on Polymarket earn rewards for resting orders, but they don't want those orders to actually fill. This bot protects them. It streams the order book over **WebSockets** and cancels an order the moment it becomes the best bid or ask.

Moving from polling to streaming cut the reaction time from **3–5 seconds to milliseconds**. It also handles reconnection and periodic re-syncs, so orders placed on the website are picked up automatically.
