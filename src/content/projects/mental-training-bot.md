A Telegram bot for **brain training**, built as a product for a mental-training community and running live. Members practise memorisation drills, and a full gamification layer of XP, streaks, achievements and a leaderboard keeps them coming back.

The main exercise is **Word Memorization**: word pairs or word chains, a study-only training mode or a timed test mode, three difficulty tiers and anywhere from 5 to 100 words. Answers use fuzzy matching with a short grace window, and members can retry mistakes or level up in one tap. A second exercise, narrated **Audio Visualization** stories, ships behind a feature flag.

Under the hood it's async throughout (`python-telegram-bot` with async SQLAlchemy on SQLite), with a modular exercise system, runtime feature flags toggled from an admin panel, and a private **Streamlit dashboard** showing time on task, engagement and where members stall.
