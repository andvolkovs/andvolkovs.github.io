A Telegram bot that watches a YouTube channel and turns each new video into **X posts written in the creator's own voice**. Nothing is published without a human saying yes.

Every idea comes in two versions: the *original*, in the creator's exact vocabulary and tone, and a *trend angle* reframed around what performs well on X. Each approved post is saved as a **style example** and fed back into future Claude prompts, so the drafts get better the more the bot is used.

Built with Python, the Anthropic API, `yt-dlp` and `youtube-transcript-api` for transcripts, `faster-whisper` as a local fallback, `tweepy` for posting, SQLite and APScheduler. It also writes long-form articles and promo copy on request.
