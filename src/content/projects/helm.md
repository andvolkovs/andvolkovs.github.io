    icon: mic
    description: Type with shorthand like "#work !now ~45", or speak, and an LLM turns the recording into task drafts. End with a board, a priority or "today" to file it there.
  - title: Plan the day
    icon: calendar-clock
    description: Today holds up to three main tasks, plus secondary ones if there's time. Unfinished ones carry over to the next day.
  - title: Focus
    icon: target
    description: One task in progress at a time, with a timer and what's up next. Starting another pauses the first.
  - title: Agents
    icon: bot
    description: Claude Code or any MCP client reads and updates the board, with scoped tokens and no delete. I can hand a task to an agent, and it sends it back for my review.
  - title: Approve
    icon: circle-check
    description: The assistant suggests an order and proposes changes. Nothing is saved until I tick it.
  - title: Sync & log
    icon: radio
    description: Every change is logged with who made it, can be undone and appears live on every device.
highlights:
  - AI agents like Claude Code use it over MCP
  - The AI proposes, I approve, and the log shows both
  - A day plan with up to three main tasks
  - Runs at home on my own Raspberry Pi, reached privately from my phone
  - Nearly 200 automated tests across 4 packages

I wanted one place to rapidly log all my tasks the moment they come into my mind, either by voice or chat. AI sorts them by project and priority. My AI agents can then access the projects and begin executing those tasks as well. The apps I used before were clunky: slow, with too many clicks and messy AI integration.

The main screen is a simple, minimalist **Focus view** with one task in progress at a time, a bit like a Pomodoro screen. **AI agents** like Claude Code connect over MCP. They can add and change tasks, but can't delete them yet. Delete might come later, when needed. In the app, the assistant suggests the order of tasks, but nothing is saved until I approve it. Every change is logged, along with who made it.

I decided on most of the main features, while AI was mainly responsible for making the UI work well and look good. Claude Code built it step by step, and I reviewed every step. It runs at home on my own **Raspberry Pi**. It's free, and I was simply curious what it would be like to host it myself. I now use it daily and log all my to-dos in it. As its main user, I can easily see new efficiencies to add.
